# My Digital Wardrobe

Our Digital Wardrobe is a web application that allows users to create a digital closet, upload clothing pieces, organize items by category, and build outfits visually. Users can save outfits for later reference, manage wardrobe pieces, and maintain a personal fashion catalog.

This project is a group project created for Women in Computing's extension program called the Sisterhood Program.
